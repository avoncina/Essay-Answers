<p><strong> Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?</strong></p>
<ul>
<p>I am interested in programming because I want my career to have a more technical focus, particularly towards data research and analysis.  I have exposure to this field by working in the fraud detection industry and as a result of living with a chronic disease.</p>
<p>I am a fraud investigator at Amazon where I analyze data patterns that indicate fraudulent activity.  I investigate accounts for indicators by sifting through various forms of gathered historic data, embedded on different platforms to analyze for inconsistencies or behavioral pattern changes. I see opportunities to automate the data gathering process and would like to be involved in development projects in the future.</p>
<p>As an Insulin Dependent Diabetic (Type 1), I want to create tools to automate the monitoring of my disease. Currently, I use logbooks to keep track of blood sugar levels, food, and insulin doses. I participate in research studies, test new continuous blood glucose levels, calculate insulin doses based on resistance, and assess activity levels when I eat. Treatment of the disease is complex, subject to many variables, inexact formulas, and requires discipline and analytical thinking to be healthy. Programming skills will help me with the care and management of my disease.</p>
</ul>

<p><strong> What are your professional goals for the next 2 years, the next 5 years?</strong></p>
<ul>
<p>I am an avid moviegoer and enjoy the process behind filmmaking. Although I am currently teaching myself how to use a camera, I would like to explore in much greater detail the inner workings of how movies are produced. Within the next two years, I would like to help create Computer Generated Imaging, or work with streaming service related companies like such as Hulu, Amazon Instant Video or Netflix. </p>
<p>Over the longer term, I would like to advance toward becoming a technical program manager for bigger entertainment companies like Amazon, DreamWorks Studios or Paramount. I would like to manage a team of programmers that would help create movies or analyze what customers may want to watch next based on films or television shows they have previously viewed. My 5-year goal is to become a manager of a team of programmers with the goal of creating theatrical products that customers would enjoy as much as I do.</p>

<p><strong> Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?</strong></p>
<ul>
<p>My biggest mistake was not accepting the reality of diabetes earlier in life and not actively managing it as well as I should have. Diagnosed when I was six years old, diabetes is something that I have struggled with.  As an adult, I have made a fuller commitment to addressing it directly. Frankly, had I been more diligent during my teenage years I would be more proficient in understanding why my insulin absorption rate, a key factor to control blood sugar levels, is erratic which makes it difficult to maintain blood sugar levels within normal range. I could have developed a better method, tailored to my biochemistry and activity levels, and tracked data more proficiently to observe trends. </p>
<p>If I could do this over, I would have done what I am doing now, which is detailed monitoring, assembling a personalized medical team that helps me understand basic questions about the disease and the data that I gather.  I now know that my body reacts differently than the non-diabetics when it comes to hormones, food, and exercise. Had I paid better attention to diabetes earlier in my life, I may have been better prepared for the challenges that lie ahead.</p>
</ul>

<p><strong> Have you taught yourself anything before? Describe what you learned and how you approached it.</strong></p>
<ul>
<p>I took piano when I was a child but never learned how to properly read sheet music.  As I grew older, I wanted to be able play more complex, songs than I had previously learned and was determined to figure out how to play them on my own. I reviewed old sheet music with my teacher’s hand-written notes. Because she wrote out the name of each note, I used this as a reference for the same notes on new sheets of music. I would then write the notes to help with muscle memory and repetition. After fully transcribing the music, I would practice a few musical bars until I had a small section memorized. After I mastered each section I would go start from the beginning until I knew how to play the entire song by heart. There were times when I would get stuck on a section because I wasn’t sure how the song flowed, or I would come across a note that I couldn’t cross-reference. Those were the times I would search for the song on YouTube or iTunes to understand the general fluidity of the song to be able to replicate it in my self-taught lessons.</p>
